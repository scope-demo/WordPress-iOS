Here’s what’s new:

Organisation overhaul: we’ve made some changes that’ll let you find what you need faster.

Want to start a new post or page? Tap the big pink button, always visible in the My Sites tab.
Want to edit your profile? Look in the upper right corner.
Want to find something to read? The Reader tab has a revamped layout for more intuitive searching and filtering.
Block editor updates: there’s a new Pullquote block, to highlight quotes with more visual emphasis than the regular Quote block. Page templates got an update to make use of the newest blocks, and we fixed up icons in a few blocks that weren’t displaying quite right in RTL mode.

The Button block got more colour options for background and text. And there’s support for superscript and subscript HTML formatting (in the classic editor, too).

Image annotation: with the new “edit image” feature in the editor, you can draw directly on images.

One really great bug fix: sometimes you’d add a Video block and start uploading a video, and the app would crash. Counterproductive! That doesn’t happen anymore.
