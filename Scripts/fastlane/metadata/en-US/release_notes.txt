New blocks! Welcome the Latest Posts block, for highlighting your new stuff in posts and pages.

When you create a new page, we’ll show you a few templates — pick one, and we’ll add all the necessary blocks to your page to get you started quickly.

We fixed up a few block editor issues; no more crashes when pasting in HTML content or missing Quote block borders in Dark Mode.

If you scheduled a post to publish in the past, it would display as “scheduled” instead of “published.” That’s fixed, along with an issue where dates displayed incorrectly if your site’s timezone wasn’t the same as your device’s timezone.

We fixed some UI inconsistencies in Dark Mode and with the Reader toolbar.

You can use @-mentions when writing comments in fullscreen mode.

Sometimes Signup and Login Magic Link emails would go to your spam folder, so we added a note to the confirmation screen suggesting that folks check their spam/junk folders if they don’t see the email promptly.

Stay safe, everyone.
