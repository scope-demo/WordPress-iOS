There’s never been a better time to use the WordPress app to manage your website — use it while hovering in the doorway of your house waiting for a curb-side delivery, in your living room while sitting six feet away from your roommate, or in the bathroom where you go to get a five minute break from your kids. The possibilities are endless, especially since v14.8 packs more features into the Block editor:

With the new Buttons block, you can add multiple buttons in the same row.
The Cover block includes more uploading options for getting pictures from your device to your site.
If your image files have captions, the Image block will automatically pre-fill them for you.

While we were poking around, we fixed a few bugs — whitespace around Text blocks getting removed, Quote blocks that didn’t align properly, and buttons in page templates not displaying correctly on the web. And we gave the screens you see post-login and signup some polish so they look cleaner and feel more consistent within the app.
